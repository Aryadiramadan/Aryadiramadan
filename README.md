Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m @Aryadiramadan
I'm a Computer Systems student with a passion for IoT and Robotics. 
I've managed projects in these fields and am proficient in C++. 
I'm also diving into project and product management to broaden my expertise.

Currently, I'm honing my skills with Arduino to bring my ideas to life. I'm always eager to learn new things and collaborate on exciting projects. 
If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
